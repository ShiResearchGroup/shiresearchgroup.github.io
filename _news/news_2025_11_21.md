Our collaborative work was just published on [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz2830)! We applied molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the Sabatier principle in designing CO2-philic but blocking membranes for H2/CO2 separations. Congratulations to Asha Jyothi Gottipalli, one of our graduated Master's student and a co-author of this work!
