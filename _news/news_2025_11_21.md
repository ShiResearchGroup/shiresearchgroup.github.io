Our collaborative work on designing CO2-philic but blocking membranes for H2/CO2 separations was just published on [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz2830)! Congratulations to Asha Jyothi Gottipalli, one of Master's students graduated from our group and a co-author of this work!
