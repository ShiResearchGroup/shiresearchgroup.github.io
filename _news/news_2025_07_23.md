Our group will attend the incoming [Gordon Research Conference on Nanoporous Materials](https://www.grc.org/nanoporous-materials-and-their-applications-conference/2025/). Chao was selected to give an oral talk at the Gordon Research Seminar. Congratulations, Chao! We look forward to seeing and making many friends there!
