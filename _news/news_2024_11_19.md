Prof. Shi's co-authored paper on gRASPA, a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo software that is designed for simulating gas adsorption in nanoporous materials, is now available online in [Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01058)! The software is open-source and freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/snurr-group/gRASPA). Give it a try! ðŸ¤¯
