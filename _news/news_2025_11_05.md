Shi Group attended the 2025 AIChE Annual Meeting in Boston this week! Chao has presented the Mofography work in poster and his PoroNet work in an oral talk. Will has presented his educational website for MOF work in poster. Our work has attracted many interests from the audience. Good job, Chao and Will!

At the conference, Prof. Shi was also elected as the Liaison Director of CoMSEF; the term will be for two years.
