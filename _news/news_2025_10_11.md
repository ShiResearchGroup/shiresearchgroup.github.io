This week, two preprints of our work on building interpretable ML models for nanoporous materials are online: [PoroNet - an intrinsically interpretable pore graph neural network](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/68b1d29ea94eede1546d3853) and [X(3)mat - an interpretable equivariant neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15908). Congratulations to Chao and Salman!
