Dr. Shi will present a poster at [Diffusion Fundamentals XI](https://diffusionfundamentals11.org/). The poster is entitled "Fickian Diffusion Models for Interpreting Experimental Characterization of Mass Transfer in Nanoporous Materials". We hope to see many old friends and make some new friends at Northwestern soon!
