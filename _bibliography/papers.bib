abstract = {Methods for characterizing the most important textural properties of porous materials, particularly pore size distribution (PSD) and specific surface area (SSA), using theoretical models to analyze standard experimental physisorp-tion isotherms are reviewed. For PSD analysis, we explain the basics of the classical methods, including those based on the Kelvin equation and adsorption potential theory, as well as the modern molecular methods based on the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular simulation. For SSA analysis, the discussion is focused on kinetic theory, and primarily on the application of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method for characterization of microporous materials. Current advances and extensions of model-based methods are discussed, including those related to machine learning techniques. We reflect on the limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods and point out some possible directions for future studies.},

abstract = {Complexes formed by polycations and DNA are of great research interest because of their prospective application in gene therapy. Whereas the applications of multiblock based polycation generally exhibit promising features, a thorough understanding on the effect of neutral block incorporated in polycation is still lacking. By using coarse-grained dynamics simulation with the help of a simple model for solvent mediated interaction, we perform a theoretical study on the physicochemical properties of various polyplexes composed of a single DNA-like polyanion chain and numbers of linear polycationic chains with different modifications. By analyzing various properties, we find the hydrophobic/hydrophilic modifications of linear polycations may bring an improvement on one aspect of the properties as gene carrier but also involve a trade-off with another one. In particular, polycation with a hydrophobic middle block and a hydrophilic tail block display distinct advantages among di- and triblock linear polycations as gene carrier, while careful design of the hydrophobic block should be made to reduce the zeta potential. The simulation results are compared with available experimental data displaying good agreements.},

In this Perspective, we review methods to calculate the microscopic pressure tensor. Connections between different pressure forms for equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems are established. We also point out several challenges in the field, including the historical controversies over the definition of the microscopic pressure tensor; the difficulties with many-body and long-range potentials; the insufficiency of software and computational tools; and the lack of experimental routes to probe the pressure tensor at the nanoscale. Possible future directions are suggested.},
