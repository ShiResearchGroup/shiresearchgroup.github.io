For now, we are talking about the high pressure phenomenon is due to the strong surface-fluid interactions for strongly wetting fluids. However, for non-wetting case, such as water on a hydrophobic surface, the freezing of the fluid near the wall is still possible due to cooperative effect of the well-oriented molecules in the ordered layer and hydrogen bonds between molecules (see Giovambattista et al, 2009 PRL)},

abstract = {We present a new equation of state for a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones (2D LJ-EOS) solid at high densities, $\rho$ * 2D ≥ 0.9. The new 2D LJ-EOS is of analytic form, consisting of a zero-temperature contribution and vibrational contributions up to and including the second anharmonic term. A detailed analysis of all contributing terms is performed. Comparisons between the 2D LJ-EOS and Monte Carlo simulation results show that the 2D LJ-EOS is very accurate over a wide range of temperatures in the high-density region. A criterion to find the temperature range over which the 2D LJ-EOS is applicable at a certain density is derived. We also demonstrate an application of the equation of state to predict an effective tangential pressure for the adsorbed contact layer near the wall in a slit-pore system. Tangential pressures predicted by this " 2D-route " are found to be in qualitative agreement with those found by the more traditional virial route of Irving and Kirkwood.

abstract = {Many material processes including surface modification and material fabrication depend on the mechanism by which polymers are adsorbed onto solid/liquid interfaces. Although the morphologies of block copolymers near the interface have been extensively investigated, the understanding of the adsorption dynamics is still limited. Here, we show that the block length determines the dynamic adsorption mode under conditions beyond the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The adsorption kinetics are investigated using in situ experimental characterization combined with Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations. Two types of symmetrical triblock copolymers, i.e., PEO-PPO-PEO, with different hydrophilic PEO block lengths are studied. While both types of copolymers present similar adsorption dynamics at concentrations below the CMC, their dynamic adsorption modes are distinct at concentrations above the CMC. The present experimental-numerical study provides a mechanistic interpretation of this difference, which casts helpful insight for the dynamic control process of surface modification and material fabrication.},

For PSD analysis, we explain the basics of the classical methods, including those based on the Kelvin equation and adsorption potential theory, as well as the modern molecular methods based on the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular simulation. For SSA analysis, the discussion is focused on kinetic theory, and primarily on the application of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method for characterization of microporous materials. Current advances and extensions of model-based methods are discussed, including those related to machine learning techniques. We reflect on the limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods and point out some possible directions for future studies.},

abstract = {Complexes formed by polycations and DNA are of great research interest because of their prospective application in gene therapy. Whereas the applications of multiblock based polycation generally exhibit promising features, a thorough understanding on the effect of neutral block incorporated in polycation is still lacking. By using coarse-grained dynamics simulation with the help of a simple model for solvent mediated interaction, we perform a theoretical study on the physicochemical properties of various polyplexes composed of a single DNA-like polyanion chain and numbers of linear polycationic chains with different modifications. By analyzing various properties, we find the hydrophobic/hydrophilic modifications of linear polycations may bring an improvement on one aspect of the properties as gene carrier but also involve a trade-off with another one. In particular, polycation with a hydrophobic middle block and a hydrophilic tail block display distinct advantages among di- and triblock linear polycations as gene carrier, while careful design of the hydrophobic block should be made to reduce the zeta potential. The simulation results are compared with available experimental data displaying good agreements.},
