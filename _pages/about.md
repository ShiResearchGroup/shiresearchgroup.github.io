Welcome to the DP (**D**igital **P**orous Materials) Lab! We are a computational and theoretical research group. We leverage machine learning, quantum and molecular-level modeling, statistical mechanics, and mathematical modeling: <br>
- To gain fundamental understanding at the interface of materials science and chemical physics. <br> 
- To develop cutting-edge porous materials solutions to major societal problems facing our planet. <br><br><br>
