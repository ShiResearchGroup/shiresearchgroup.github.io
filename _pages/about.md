We are a computational and theoretical research group. We leverage quantum and molecular-level modeling, statistical mechanics, machine learning, and mathematical modeling to 



The overarching goal of our research group is to better understand the nature of nanoporous adsorbents, and their unique confinement and surface effects on nanophases and reactions, by integrating physics-based and data-based computational methods, with the hope to address major societal problems facing our planet. <br>


Our group leverages data science, statistical mechanics, molecular modeling, and machine learning tools to design and discover new materials and address some of societyâ€™s most pressing technological needs. We also collaborate with other groups in the United States and around the world to develop and deploy new technologies.
