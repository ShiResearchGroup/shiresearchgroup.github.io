### What are we interested in? <br>
**We currently have one (1) postdoctoral position available in our group.** Areas of interest include machine learning potential for porous materials, molecular simulation method development for gas adsorption, and machine learning for materials discovery and design for energy storage and chemical separation applications. Interested postdocs should inquire directly at `kaihangshi0@gmail.com` with a CV and a brief statement (3-5 sentences) of your research interests and professional goals. <br><br>

### What are we going to do? <br>
**We are currently recruiting highly self-motivated Ph.D. and Master students to join our group.** Opportunities are broadly in the areas of machine learning for accelerated materials discovery and design, AI-guided theories and tools for experimental materials characterization, and statistical mechanics and simulations for confined fluids and nucleations. The exact projects will vary and should reflect our mutual interests and funding. Interested students are encouraged to email `kaihangshi0@gmail.com` with your CV and research interests. <br><br>
