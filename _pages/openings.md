### Postdoctoral positions <br>
**We currently have one (1) postdoctoral position available in our group.** Areas of interest include machine learning interatomic potential, molecular simulation method development, and machine learning for materials discovery and design. Interested postdocs should inquire directly at `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with a CV and a brief statement (3-5 sentences) of your research interests and professional goals. <br><br>

### Openings for graduate students <br>
**We are currently recruiting highly self-motivated Master students to join our group.** Opportunities are broadly in the areas of machine learning for accelerated materials discovery and design, advanced theories and tools for experimental materials characterization, and statistical mechanics and simulations for confined fluids and chemical reactions. The exact projects will vary and should reflect our mutual interests and funding. Interested students are encouraged to email `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with your CV and research interests. More details can be found on [Graduate Admissions](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological/academics/graduate/admissions.html) page. <br><br>

### Undergraduates and high school students<br>
**We currently have one (1) undergraduate Research Assistant position available with full financial support, thanks to the UB Research and Creative Activities for Undergraduates Program.** [LINK](https://shiresearchgroup.github.io/openings/ura1)If you are interested in this position, please email `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with your interests, CV, and transcript. The research project for this paid position will be "Computational Discovery of Materials for CO2 Capture":<br>

*There has been a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 levels over the past century, sparking significant concerns about global warming. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of "spongy" porous materials for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere or point emission sources. Their modular synthesis nature allows for targeted tuning of material properties and for virtually unlimited variations in the material's structure and chemistry.* <br>

*We are looking for a highly self-driven undergraduate student at UB to test a new molecular simulation method for modeling gas adsorption in MOFs. The student will play a major role in testing this new simulation method on characteristic MOF materials and evaluating the computational efficiency and accuracy of the method. The student will also have the chance to dive into the development of new simulation algorithms. The ultimate goal is to apply this new molecular simulation method to efficiently search the large materials space for promising MOFs that can be eventually deployed in practical chemical processes for CO2 mitigation. This is a chance to learn how to simulate molecular behavior in silico and how machine learning can help solve global challenges. Join our team and let's discover new materials to save the planet!* <br>

Project outcomes: The student will gain valuable skills and knowledge in molecular modeling, machine learning, and computational materials, in the context of gas adsorption in nanoporous materials. They will also develop strong communication skills through presentations in group meetings and one-on-one meetings with the advisor. If the project is successful, the student will have the chance to publish their research outcome in professional journals and present their work at local symposiums or national conferences. 

**In general, we are always eager to welcome interested undergraduate and high school students to our lab.** We have multiple projects available for students who are interested in getting hands-on experience with machine learning, molecular simulation, statistical thermodynamics, and mathematical modeling, in the general area of chemical engineering. You can email `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with your interests and background.<br><br>
