### Postdoctoral positions <br>
**We currently have one (1) postdoctoral position available in our group.** Areas of interest include machine learning potential for porous materials, molecular simulation method development for gas adsorption, and machine learning for materials discovery and design for energy storage and chemical separation applications. Interested postdocs should inquire directly at `kaihangshi0@gmail.com` with a full CV and a brief statement (2-3 sentences) of your research interests. 
<br>
### Openings for graduate students <br>
**We are currently recruiting highly self-motivated Ph.D. and Master students to join our group.** Opportunities are broadly in the areas of machine learning for accelerated materials discovery and design, AI-guided theories and tools for experimental materials characterization, and statistical mechanics and simulations for confined fluids and nucleations. 
<br>
### Undergraduates <br>
**We are always eager to welcome interested UB undergraduate students to our lab.** We have multiple projects available for undergraduate students who are interested in getting hands-on experiences in machine learning for science, molecular simulations, and statistical thermodynamics for understanding complex phenomena related to chemical engineering applications.
