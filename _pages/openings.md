### Postdoctoral positions <br>
**We currently have one (1) postdoctoral position available in our group.** Areas of interest include molecular simulation method development and machine learning for porous materials. Interested postdocs should inquire directly at `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with a CV and a brief statement (3-5 sentences) of your research interests and professional goals. <br><br>

### Openings for graduate students <br>
**Fall 2026: [Prof. Jiayu Peng](https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/jiayu-peng-lab/) and I are seeking a co-advised PhD student to join our research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, materials science, and chemical engineering.** We are particularly looking to recruit through the [Computational and Data-Enabled Sciences (CDES) PhD program](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/academics/grad/cdse-phd.html), an interdisciplinary degree that integrates data science, numerical algorithms, and high-performance computing to drive discovery in science and engineering. **The program requires applicants to already hold a Master’s degree and is designed for completion within 3 years.** If you’re interested, we’d love to hear from you! Reach out to us by email to learn more about our research and opportunities. When applying, please mention both of our names (Dr. Jiayu Peng and Dr. Kaihang Shi) in your statement of purpose and the application portal. <br>

**We are currently recruiting highly self-motivated PhD and Master students to join our group.** Opportunities are broadly in the areas of machine learning for accelerated materials discovery and design, advanced theories and tools for experimental materials characterization, and statistical mechanics and simulations for confined fluids and chemical reactions. The exact projects will vary and should reflect our mutual interests and funding. Interested students are encouraged to email `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with your CV and research interests. More details can be found on [Graduate Admissions](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological/academics/graduate/admissions.html) page. <br>

<!-- We also recruit PhD student through the [Computational and Data-Enabled Sciences PhD Program](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/academics/grad/cdse-phd.html). If you are more interested in the AI/ML track of PhD research, please check it out!<br><br> -->

### Undergraduates and high school students<br>
**We are currently recruiting a highly self-motivated undergraduate student to join our group to study large language models for scientific discovery.** If you are interested in this position, please email `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with your interests, CV, and transcript. <br>

**In general, we are always eager to welcome interested undergraduate and high school students to our lab.** We have multiple projects available for students who are interested in getting hands-on experience with machine learning, molecular simulation, statistical thermodynamics, and mathematical modeling, in the general area of chemical and materials engineering. You can email `kaihangs@buffalo.edu` with your interests and background.<br><br>
