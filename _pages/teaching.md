    Instruction begins when you, the teacher, learn from the learner; put yourself in his place so that you may understand… what he learns and the way he understands it.

**CE 525: Advanced Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics** (Fall 23-25)<br>
This course is a graduate-level core course that provides a rigorous and unified treatment of classical and statistical thermodynamics with direct relevance to modern chemical engineering research and practice. The course emphasizes thermodynamic analysis of non-ideal fluids, phase equilibria, and high-pressure systems, while introducing statistical mechanics as a molecular foundation for macroscopic thermodynamic laws. Students will develop the ability to derive and apply fundamental thermodynamic relations, interpret phase behavior, and connect probability distributions and partition functions to measurable properties. The course also introduces molecular simulation methods, including Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics, to bridge theory with computational practice and contemporary research problems in fluids and materials. <br><br>

**CE 400/500: Special Topics: AI for Chemical Engineers** <br>
This course is a new elective course, cross-listed for both undergraduate and graduate students. All course materials will be made publicly available soon via GitHub. Stay tuned!
