**CE 525: Advanced Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics** (Fall 23-25)<br>
This course is a graduate-level core course that provides a rigorous and unified treatment of classical and statistical thermodynamics with direct relevance to modern chemical engineering research and practice. The course emphasizes thermodynamic analysis of non-ideal fluids, phase equilibria, and high-pressure systems, while introducing statistical mechanics as a molecular foundation for macroscopic thermodynamic laws. Students will develop the ability to derive and apply fundamental thermodynamic relations, interpret phase behavior, and connect probability distributions and partition functions to measurable properties. The course also introduces molecular simulation methods, including Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics, to bridge theory with computational practice and contemporary research problems in fluids and materials. <br><br>

**CE 400/500: Special Topics: AI for Chemical Engineers** (Fall 25)<br>




This course is a new elective course, cross-listed for both undergraduate and graduate students, designed to equip chemical engineers with practical and conceptual foundations in modern artificial intelligence. The course begins with an overview of AI and hands-on exposure to large language models (LLMs) and AI-assisted Python programming, then progressively introduces predictive AI (regression, tree-based models, and neural networks), prescriptive AI (genetic algorithms and Bayesian optimization), and generative AI (VAEs, diffusion models, and LLM-based agents). Throughout the semester, students engage in interactive notebooks and case studies drawn from chemical engineering applications such as process monitoring, materials and molecular discovery, and optimization of synthesis and operating conditions. The course also addresses real-world considerations including ethics, safety, and limitations of AI, and features guest lectures from academia and industry. A mid-term journal review and a final project presentation allow students to critically evaluate current AI research and apply AI tools to open-ended chemical engineering problems. <br>

All course materials will be made publicly available soon via GitHub. Stay tuned!
